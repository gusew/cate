libunittest (5.0.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Moved assertions out of unittest::testcase and into their own namespace:
    unittest::assertions. In order to migrate existing code, add this
    to the top of your source file: using namespace unittest::assertions.
  * Moved fail() method out of unittest::testcase. Migrate existing code
    by adding: using unittest::fail.
  * Added two new command line options (-l, -r) to control display behavior
  * Removed the ability to override display controlling formatting methods 
    -> use command line switches instead

libunittest (3.6.0) stable; urgency=low

  * removed 'has_timed_out' as an XML attribute of tag 'testcase'
  * added new attribute 'assertions' to tag 'testcase' which is filled
    with the assertion that triggered the failed test
  * only those attributes of tag 'testcase' are displayed that are provided
    with information, e.g., classname doesn't show up if there is no class name
  * tests that were skipped didn't show up in the output XML. Now they do
    and are marked with the empty tag 'skipped'
  * added macro UNITTEST_LOGTEXT (or shortcut LOGTEXT) which can be used
    to provide further information about the current test -> see examples
  * all info passed to LOGTEXT is forwarded to stdout in case of errors
    or failures
  * all info passed to LOGTEXT is forwarded to the output XML and 
    appears under the new tag 'system-out'
  * unittest::deps had the wrong type -> changed it to double
